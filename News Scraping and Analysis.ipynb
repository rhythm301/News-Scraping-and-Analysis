The front gate and wall on the property is all that has survived untouched, with intact mail still in the letter box. Behind it, two burned out cars sit in the driveway, and in the back a swing set is destroyed. But tucked into some bushes was a bucket and a toy lawn mower. \"Mommy look, they survived! We hid them in the bushes because we knew there would be a fire!\" Henry excitedly yelled Henry and his brother Lucas inspected the remaining plants: \"This one survived! This didn't. Our tomato plant is dead.\" Few other treasures survived. Henry's family had packed light, not wanting to overload their car in case they had to sleep in it. Just a few essentials and the family dogs. \"Henry was sad. He got a new 3D printer and it was destroyed.

Keith, her husband, wades in: \"I'm looking at what's left of my kitchen.\" The family has lived in this house for three years. Keith is originally from England but has been in the US for 40 years. Deisy and Keith are sending Henry and Lucas to family in Florida while they figure out what to do. They've been staying in a hotel. Deisy said it's hard for them all to be separated, but it's what is best. \"After a week they get homesick and start crying 'I want to come back to California.' But they have no home to come back to.

      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse It was 20:25 on a Monday evening in November 2020 when Caroline Darian got the call that changed everything. On the other end of the phone was her mother, Gisèle Pelicot. \"She announced to me that she discovered that morning that [my father] Dominique had been drugging her for about 10 years so that different men could rape her,\" Darian recalls in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme's Emma Barnett. \"At that moment, I lost what was a normal life,\" says Darian, now 46. \"I remember I shouted, I cried, I even insulted him,\" she says. \"It was like an earthquake. A tsunami.\" Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail at the end of a historic three-and-a-half month trial in December. More than four years later, Darian says that her father \"should die in prison\".\n",

      "Fifty men who Dominique Pelicot recruited online to come rape and sexually assault his unconscious wife Gisèle were also sent to jail. He was caught by police after upskirting in a supermarket, leading investigators to look closer at him. On this seemingly innocuous retired grandfather's laptop and phones, they found thousands of videos and photos of his wife Gisèle, clearly unconscious, being raped by strangers. On top of pushing issues of rape and gender violence into the spotlight, the trial also highlighted the little-known issue of chemical submission - drug-facilitated assault. Caroline Darian has made it her life's struggle to fight chemical submission, which is thought to be under-reported as the majority of victims don't have any recollection of the assaults and may not even realise they were drugged.\n",

Soon afterwards, Darian herself was called in by police - and her world shattered again. She was shown two photos they found on her father's laptop. They showed an unconscious woman lying on a bed, wearing only a T-shirt and underwear. At first, she couldn't tell the woman was her. \"I lived a dissociation effect. I had difficulties recognising myself from the start,\" she says. \"Then the police officer said: 'Look, you have the same brown mark on your cheek... it's you.'

But I don't have any evidence,\" she says. Unlike her mother's case, there is no proof of what Pelicot may have done to Darian. \"And that's the case for how many victims? They are not believed because there's no evidence. They're not listened to, not supported,\" she says. Soon after her father's crimes came to light, Darian wrote a book. I'll Never Call Him Dad Again explores her family's trauma. It also delves deeper into the issue of chemical submission, in which the drugs typically used \"come from the family's medicine cabinet\". \"Painkillers, sedatives. It's medication,\" Darian says. As is the case for almost half of victims of chemical submission, she knew her abuser: the danger, she says, \"is coming from the inside.\" She says that in the midst of the trauma of finding out she had been raped more than 200 times by different people, her mother Gisèle found it difficult to accept that her husband may have also assaulted their daughter. \"For a mum it's difficult to integrate that all in one go,\" she says. Yet when Gisèle decided to open up the trial to the public and the media so as to expose what had been done to her by her husband and dozens of men, mother and daughter were in agreement: \"I knew we went through something... horrible, but that we had to go through it with dignity and strength.\"\n",

      "Now, Darian needs to understand how to live knowing she is the daughter of both the torturer and the victim - something she calls \"a terrible burden\". She is now unable to think back to her childhood with the man she calls Dominique, only occasionally slipping back into the habit of referring to him as her father. \"When I look back I don't really remember the father that I thought he was. I look straight to the criminal, the sexual criminal he is,\" she says. \"But I have his DNA and the main reason why I am so engaged for invisible victims is also for me a way to put a real distance with this guy,\" she tells Emma Barnett. \"I am totally different from Dominique.\" Darian adds she doesn't know whether her father was a \"monster,\" as some have called him. \"He knew perfectly well what he did, and he's not sick,\" she says. \"He is a dangerous man. There is no way he can get out. No way.\" It will be years before Dominique Pelicot, 72, is eligible for parole, so it is possible he will never see his family again. Meanwhile, the Pelicots are rebuilding themselves. Gisèle, Darian says, is exhausted from the trial, but also \"recovering... She is doing well\".\n",

The events that were unleashed on that November day made her who she is today, Darian says. Now, this woman whose life was wrecked by a tsunami on a November night is trying to only look ahead.\n",

The average low in northern Scotland for this time of year is about 0.3C, while for England, overnight lows are about 1.5C to 1.6C.

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has defended her decision to travel to China to improve economic ties at a time when soaring government borrowing costs threaten to squeeze UK public finances. She says she wants a long-term relationship with China that is \"squarely in our national interest\" and on Saturday said agreements reached in Beijing would be worth £600m to the UK over the next five years. Her trip has been overshadowed by UK borrowing costs hitting a 16-year high and a fall in the value of the pound, with the Conservatives accusing Reeves of having \"fled to China\". Speaking during a visit to UK bike maker Brompton's Beijing store, Reeves insisted she would not alter her economic plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reeves met Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Beijing, discussing trade and investment opportunities as part of efforts to grow the UK economy and raise living standards. Following the talks, the UK Treasury said both countries had agreed to deeper co-operation in trade, financial services, investment and climate issues. China is the world's second largest economy and the UK's fourth largest single trading partner. According to the Treasury, exports to the country supported more than 455,000 UK jobs in 2020. \"Growth is the number one mission of this government,\" Reeves said. \"The fiscal rules laid out in the Budget are non-negotiable. Economic stability is the bedrock for economic growth and prosperity.\" But the market movements create a potential problem for Reeves if she wants to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. She has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors. But UK borrowing costs have been rising in recent months and this week the cost of borrowing over 10 years hit its highest level since 2008. The pound also dropped on Friday to below $1.22. The market turbulence also comes as growth in the UK economy has been stagnant and businesses are bracing themselves for tax rises due to come into effect in April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters Officials said the chancellor would raise \"difficult issues\" with Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng on her trip\n",
      "\n",
      "The Treasury said Reeves' visit to China delivered on a \"commitment to explore deeper economic co-operation\" between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and President Xi, made last year. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said other European nations such as Spain have encouraged China not just to set up factories but to transfer its advanced battery technology, for example, into Europe. He said the UK now risks upsetting the new US administration of Donald Trump if it encourages China's role as part of its own green growth strategy. During Saturday's meeting with the Chinese vice-premier, Reeves discussed Hong Kong and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. She said: \"We discussed that there will need to be areas where we disagree and it is important that we can have open and frank exchange on these issues. \"That includes concerns on national and economic security, market access and impacts of subsidies and industrial policy to ensure a level playing field exists.\" Tory MP and former security minister Tom Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the timing of Reeves' visit to China was questionable. \"She's going at a time when her Budget has sacked the economy, we've got debt rates going up, and she looks like she's going with a begging bowl, not with a trading deal,\" he said. \"That's a real problem because actually it makes the UK look more vulnerable, and others around the world will see it too.\" Tugendhat said Reeves had not made it \"clear at all\" what she has hoping to gain through her visit. \"We don't use the second most important person in government to do anything other than to fundamentally change a relationship,\" he said. \"Well, she hasn't told us what that change is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had \"blown hot and cold\" in its relations with China over recent decades, suggesting the Chinese government might be \"pretty sceptical\" about British policies towards it. On the chancellor's fiscal rules, Mr Johnson said it would be very difficult for her to abandon them. He said: \"She's really nailed her colours to the mast there and we have seen that the markets are pretty concerned about the UK position. That is partly because we are so dependent on international flows of finance to finance our debt and trade deficit.\" In addition to expanding current financial services trade in Shanghai, the government has said talks would look to \"bring down barriers\" that British businesses face in trying to export or expand to China. Reeves is joined by Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey, Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Nikhil Rathi and other senior representatives from some of Britain's biggest financial services firms. But the visit also comes after MPs challenged Chinese-founded fashion retailer Shein over its supply chains amid allegations of forced labour and human rights abuses. Shein has denied the claims. On Tuesday, a senior lawyer representing Shein repeatedly refused to say whether the company sold products containing cotton from the Xinjiang region, an area in which China has been accused of subjecting Uyghur Muslims to forced labour.\n",

      "Getty Images Donald Trump's son Donald Jr recently visited Greenland\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent weeks, US President-elect Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island. He first indicated an intention to buy Greenland in 2019, during his first term as president, but this week he went further, refusing to rule out economic or military force to take control of it. Danish and European officials have responded negatively, saying Greenland is not for sale and its territorial integrity must be preserved. So how could this unusual situation play out, with two Nato allies at odds over a huge territory which is 80% covered with ice but has considerable untapped mineral wealth? And how could the aspirations for independence among Greenland's population of 56,000, under Danish control for 300 years, affect the final outcome? Here we look at four possible scenarios for Greenland's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump loses interest, nothing happens\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some speculation that Trump's move is just bluster, a move to get Denmark to boost Greenland's security in the face of the threat of both Russia and China seeking influence in the region. Last month, Denmark announced a new $1.5bn (£1.2bn) military package for the Arctic. It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\". \"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper. Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence. So even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue. But independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction. \"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.\n",

      "\n",
      "There is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it. However, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system. \"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC. One possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau. Denmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it. \"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility. The recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds. But even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security. An agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted. Dr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role. \"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.\n",

      "Trump steps up economic pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland. Professor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory. Trump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US. Possible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch. One of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk. Analysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.\n",

That equates to about 450,000 more young adults still living in the family home - with the increase concentrated on those in their late 20s, researchers found. Of 25 to 34-year-olds, men were more likely than women to be living at home, at 23% compared with 15%. The IFS said that this age group had changed over recent decades, so had become less likely to be married and have children. They were also more ethnically diverse, and UK-born young people from Bangladeshi and Indian backgrounds were more likely to live with their parents. The peak of adult children living at home was during the pandemic, when more than a fifth of 25 to 34-year-olds did so. Now, in more normal times, parents may hope their grown-up children would fly the nest, but many of the 20-somethings would wish they could afford to do so. The IFS said finances were a significant sticking point, with rising rents and house prices fuelling the trend.\n",

      "Ten Reform UK councillors in Derbyshire say they have resigned in protest over Nigel Farage's leadership. The group said Reform was being run in an \"increasingly autocratic manner\" and \"has lost its sense of direction\" since Farage took over as leader last June. But Farage told BBC Newsnight the councillors who had quit were put forward by a \"rogue branch\" of the party and that \"none of them passed vetting\". The Clacton MP also said he and Elon Musk had patched up their relationship after the tech billionaire posted on the X social media platform that Reform needed a new leader.\n",

      "\"We had a rogue branch putting people up and I think you'll find, in many cases, there will have to be by-elections because they were not legitimately put forward,\" Farage told Newsnight.

The 10 signatories include Stevenson and nine others, who hold a mix of seats at county, town and parish level. Nine of the 10 appear to stand on Heanor and Loscoe Town Council in Derbyshire.

In a statement on X, Zia Yusuf, Reform UK's chairman said: \"The leader of this group of 'councillors' was suspended weeks ago by Reform for nominating candidates that failed vetting [and] fraudulently nominating candidates with an invalid DNO certificate. \"As a result of [the latter], several of these 'councillors' are illegitimate and new elections must be held. Reform stands for the highest standards in public life, and those who commit fraud will always be expelled.\" Asked about Habib's departure from the party, Farage told the BBC: \"Good riddance\". It comes after US tech billionaire Elon Musk said Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party - but did not explain his reasoning. Farage told Newsnight that Musk had wanted him to \"come out strongly and support [former EDL leader] Tommy Robinson.\" \"Whilst many things Tommy Robinson has said have been right and it's wrong he's in solitary confinement, I certainly don't want Tommy Robinson in my party,\" he said.

The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a \"shifting legal and policy landscape\". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta - the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp - cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term \"DEI\" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become \"charged\". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was \"winding down outdated programs and materials\" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. \"Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture,\" Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of \"woke\" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are \"diverse\" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering \"equity and inclusion\" training and instead offer programmes that \"mitigate bias for all, no matter your background\". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration.\n",

The local office of the US National Weather Service published a strongly worded alert at roughly 10:30am local time. At almost that exact moment, a fire erupted in the Palisades neighbourhood of LA. \"The fire was able to get started, get a foothold, and then the wind came in and pushed it really, really hard,\" says Ellie Graeden, co-chief executive of RedZone Analytics, which makes wildfire modelling products for the insurance industry. \"This is really as bad as it can get.\" The fire exploded, followed by other wildfires in nearby areas. Thousands of homes and other buildings have been razed. Sunset Boulevard is in ruins. At the time of writing, LA's fires have killed at least 10 people. Officials have ordered nearly 180,000 people to evacuate. The fires now rank as the most destructive in LA's history, with some estimates of the damage put at between $52bn-57bn (£42bn-£46bn).\n",

      "Getty Images It's unclear how the LA fires started - but most wildfires are caused by humans\n",

      "'A really explosive situation'\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, a confluence of environmental conditions came together with devastating timing. A combination of long-term drought and heavy rainfall in the days before provided the fuel, while powerful – and at times hurricane-force – winds fanned the fires into raging infernos. At the outset, the Santa Ana winds as they are known – strong and gusty winds that blow from inland towards the coast – reached speeds of 80mph (129km/h), supercharging the inferno. Disastrously, the high winds prevented some firefighting helicopters and planes from taking to the skies in order to dump water on the burning areas. \"Without that air support, we're basically playing whack-a-mole to prevent losses at specific points,\" says Ms Graeden. These conditions come against the backdrop of climate change, which is not only increasing the risk of wildfires around the world, but also making them particularly explosive. This is when relatively small blazes rapidly \"blow up\" so suddenly and with such ferocity that they become difficult to control.\n",

      "In California, the risk of such extremely fast-growing fires has increased by an estimated 25% due to human-caused climate change, according to some models. Rising temperatures and prolonged periods of drought are stripping vegetation and dead plant material of their moisture, meaning when a fire does start, there can be no stopping it. Matt Jones, an Earth system scientist at the University of East Anglia, who studies the impact of climate change on wildfires, notes that, in 2022 and 2023, LA received extraordinary amounts of rain. Some 52.46in (133cm) of precipitation hit downtown LA during this period, which was nearly a record. That excessive rain helped plants in the area to grow but then, in 2024, the weather changed. Last year was extremely dry in contrast to the previous two years. It means that there is currently a large volume of dried-out vegetation scattered around southern California. \"We're left with a really explosive situation,\" says Mr Jones.\n",

      "Fire and wind: the Santa Ana effect\n",
      "\n",
      "There was also the significant influence of the windstorm. The Santa Ana winds go by various names, depending on where you live. Known as the Föhn or Föhnwind in the Alpine regions of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they are associated in folk belief with a range of symptoms including migraines, depression, sleeplessness, confusion, and increased risk of accidents. One account published in a scientific journal in 1911 reveals the dramatic effects of the Föhnwind in Innsbruck, Austria: \"This wind often blows with great violence, and unless one's windows are promptly closed everything in the house is speedily covered with a thick layer of dust.\" Climate change is creating hotter conditions in some locations where Santa Ana-like winds occur, meaning that the impact or potential consequences – especially in terms of rapidly escalating wildfires – is worsening.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to some research, these winds are becoming more common in parts of the world due to climate change. The effect on wildfires of such an increase could be profound. In Switzerland, for example, researchers found Föhn winds led to fires burning three times as much area than on days where there were no such winds. Fires that spread very quickly are particularly dangerous – not just because of the threat to human life and property, but also because of how widespread those fires can become. Research published last year examined the frequency of \"blow up\" fire events that suddenly escalate. Notably, it was areas where fires burned intensely for relatively short periods of time that ended up burning larger areas overall. \"Single-day extreme fire spread events are disproportionately shaping North American landscapes,\" the authors wrote. They estimated that, between 2002 and 2021, North American fires that burned more than 1,704 hectares (4210 acres) in a single day burned an average of 2.3 million hectares (5.7 million acres) annually overall. Mediterranean California, where LA is located, is especially prone to rapidly escalating, wide-burning fires, according to the study.\n",

      "Wildfires 'make their own weather'\n",
      "\n",
      "While the downslope Santa Ana winds appear to have accelerated the LA wildfires, very different conditions can also cause fires to blow up. In the absence of powerful winds, wildfires can sometimes make their own weather, says Mr Jones. \"They generate their own, strong, localised winds, which can affect both the pace at which the fire spreads but also trigger erratic directional changes,\" he explains. As a blaze heats the air above it, it can create updrafts powerful enough to form huge pyrocumulative clouds in the sky above. The appearance of such a cloud can indicate that a wildfire is about to escalate rapidly, or that this process has already begun, research published in 2021 found. Such storm clouds can cause lightning strikes, which could ignite yet more fires nearby.\n",

      "This interplay of wind and fire is a common theme. \"You can, in certain parts of the globe, get a rapidly growing fire during [the] passage of a front – a weather system that basically gives you the wind but doesn't bring you the precipitation,\" explains John Abatzoglou, professor of climatology at the University of California, Merced. Fires tend to run up hillsides in the absence of Santa Ana winds, says Prof Abatzoglou, though in places like California, the Santa Ana winds can push fires down hills instead. Similar downslope winds were also thought to have played a role in the deadly Maui wildfires in Hawaii in 2023. In either case, fast-developing fires are very problematic when they occur near towns and cities. \"Within a matter of hours from ignition you had huge numbers of people that were impacted,\" says Prof Abatzoglou, referring to the situation in LA.\n",

      "Some residents have also been looking into ways to attempt to fireproof their homes. Those with the greatest resources might take inspiration from the Getty Villa, a museum in the Pacific Palisades. (Though perhaps not without irony. The museum was originally built by J Paul Getty, an early 20th-Century oil tycoon.) Staff routinely trim trees and shrubs in the gardens to ensure there is not an excess of vegetation available to provide fuel for fires. The building's galleries also have double walls and staff can control, to some extent, the flow of hot air into the villa via the air conditioning system. But the fact that fires can leapfrog for several miles makes containment difficult. Embers from burning vegetation can be whipped up and carried by the wind, allowing new fires to ignite some distance away. Rather than catching fire from direct contact with flames, many homes begin to burn due to embers that can fly miles, entering through eaves or gable vents. Homeowners can replace porous vents with fire-resistant ones designed to keep out windswept embers, and install ember-resistant gutter guards that allow rainwater but stop vegetation from piling up on the roofline. Despite the grandeur of some LA mansions, however, many were left ravaged by the recent fires – including multiple homes belonging to celebrities. The biggest wildfires could likely overwhelm even the most fortified properties.\n",

The city rents goats, for instance, so that the animals can graze brush from hillsides. \"The reception is overwhelmingly positive wherever we go,\" goat herder Michael Choi said in a recent interview. \"It's a win-win scenario as far as I can tell.\" There are also efforts to use high-tech camera-based surveillance systems to watch for developing wildfires, and supercomputers that try to predict when fires are most likely to occur. That said, these systems were in place in LA last week but that did not stop the latest fires claiming lives and leaving vast areas in ruins. Homeowners who live in wildfire-prone locations need to think about their own vulnerability, says Ms Graeden: \"This is a risk that is not necessarily seasonal anymore. This is the type of risk that people need to be taking very seriously at all times.\" She recommends clearing as much vegetation from around residential properties as possible, and installing a fire-resistant roof or a sprinkler system. Having an evacuation plan in place could also save lives. When efforts to repair and rebuild homes in LA eventually get underway, it is possible some may turn to fire-resistant materials such as bricks made of earth.\n",

      "'I have nothing to go back to' - fires heartbreak As the world gets hotter, and as rainfall patterns become more erratic, we may see fires like those in LA erupt with increasing frequency. Abatzoglou highlights the 2024 wildfires in Chile and Greece as key examples in which very dry conditions set the stage for catastrophe. In 2023 fires hit Canada and burned an area larger than England - these were also fuelled by high temperatures and drought. Climate change brings dangerous variability, notes Abatzoglou. That swing in weather we've seen in southern California, from a period of heavy rainfall to suddenly hot, dry, fire-sparking conditions – known as \"hydroclimate whiplash\" – is clearly very problematic. \"It's really these sequences that I think are important when it comes to fire,\" says Abatzoglou. \"Rapid swings between unusually wet to unusually dry conditions. That's something we are seeing across the globe.\"\n",

A curfew is in place from 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT) to 06:00 on Saturday within the areas affected by the Pacific Palisades and Eaton fires after reports of looting. More than 10,000 buildings have been razed by the fires, which are the most destructive in the history of LA. A further 60,000 are also at risk. Insured losses are expected to be above $8bn (£6.5bn) because of the high value of the properties damaged. A man was arrested on Thursday afternoon after residents suspected he was attempting to start a new fire. Police said he was charged with a probation violation but that there was not enough probable cause to charge him with arson, and an investigation continues. The causes of the original fires are not yet known. National Guard troops have been deployed in some parts of the city to prevent looting in evacuated areas, with more set to be deployed, and there have been 20 arrests, according to police.

      "A political row about the city's preparedness has erupted after reports that some firefighters' hoses ran dry, provoking criticism from US President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of being responsible for the city's struggling water supply. Fact-checking criticism of California Democrats over fires In Pasadena, around 11 miles (18km) north-east of downtown LA, Fire Chief Chad Augustin said the area experienced a short period of time where pressure was low on a small amount of hydrants. All issues had been resolved, he said. He attributed the issue to multiple fire engines drawing water at the same time, as well as a loss of power lowering pressure. Hydrants also ran out of water for a time in the more elevated parts of Pacific Palisades. Adam Van Gerpen, a captain with the LA fire department, told the BBC on Friday that some fire crews had run out of water. \"I have witnessed that,\" he said from his fire truck as he and other crews battled the Palisades blaze, adding that in such situations, firefighters transfer water from other fire engines. Newsom said on Friday he was ordering an independent investigation into the loss of water pressure and the closure of a reservoir in Pacific Palisades, which was shut for maintenance before the fires began. \"Losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,\" he said in a post on X. Mayor Karen Bass returned to the city from a previously arranged trip to Ghana to find it on fire. She has faced intense questions about the region's preparedness, her leadership in this crisis, and the water issues. Before the fires broke out, LA's fire chief warned in a memo that budget cuts were hampering the department's ability to respond to emergencies. Dismay over the fire threat was worsened by an alert that was mistakenly sent to every mobile phone in Los Angeles on Thursday, residents say, prompting anger from some. About 10 million people live in the county. A second emergency alert warning residents to prepare to evacuate was mistakenly sent out to residents in the early hours of Friday. During a news conference Friday morning, city authorities said they were investigating why the mass alert was sent out, and urged people not to disable the alert function on their phones, which they said was vital to provide up-to-the-minute emergency information.\n",
      "\n",
      "What caused the fires?\n",
      "\n",
      "A combination of an exceptionally dry period - downtown Los Angeles has only received 0.16 inches (0.4cm) of rain since October - and powerful offshore gusts known as the Santa Ana winds have created ripe conditions for wildfires. Santa Ana winds flow east to west through southern California's mountains, according to the National Weather Service. The winds can also be responsible for the scale of destruction that follows. Blowing across the deserts further inland, they create conditions where humidity drops, which dries out vegetation. If a fire does start, the winds can fan smouldering embers into an inferno in minutes. Speeds of 60 to 80mph (95-130km/h) are common, but gusts of up to 100mph (160km/h) can occur. US President Joe Biden said on Friday that while firefighters were \"able to partially prevent\" some of the fires from spreading, winds would remain a threat until early next week. Investigations into what initially sparked the fires are continuing. LA District Attorney Nathan Hochman said that the focus of law enforcement was currently on saving lives and homes and assisting firefighters, but that eventually they would turn towards investigating the causes of the fires. \"If it is determined that there is a man-made and intentional setting of any of the fires involved in this situation, the people who committed this arson will be arrested, they will be prosecuted and they will be punished to the full extent of the law,\" he said. Hochman also warned people against looting and flying drones - one struck a firefighting plane, which was damaged but able to land without any injuries - and warned of scams targeting fire victims. Arson is not the only cause of deadly wildfires. Power lines and other utility equipment have sparked some of the most destructive blazes in California's history. In 2018, the so-called Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 85 people, many of whom died in their cars trying to flee. BBC weather forecaster Sarah Keith-Lucas says there is no rain forecast in the area for at least the next week, so conditions remain ripe for fire. Although winds were expected to ease slightly later Friday into Saturday, forecasters warned that they would pick up again on Sunday into Monday.\n",

      "What role has climate change played?\n",
      "\n",
      "Although strong winds and lack of rain are driving the blazes, experts say climate change is altering the background conditions and increasing the likelihood of such fires. Much of the western United States including California experienced a decades-long drought that ended just two years ago, making the region vulnerable. \"Whiplash\" swings between dry and wet periods in recent years created a massive amount of tinder-dry vegetation that was ready to burn. US government research is unequivocal in linking climate change to larger and more severe wildfires in the western US. \"Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. Fire season in southern California is generally thought to stretch from May to October - but Gov Newsom has pointed out earlier that blazes had become a perennial issue. \"There's no fire season,\" he said. \"It's fire year.\"\n",

      "LA wildfire damages set to cost record $135bn Newsom opposed this at the time, saying he wanted to protect \"highly imperilled fish species close to extinction\". That is what Trump is referencing in his post blaming Newsom for the response to the wildfires, where he says the governor \"wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish\", Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt has confirmed. California's attorney general ultimately blocked the measure, citing potential harm to endangered species and saying that it was not scientifically justified. Jeffrey Mount, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California's Water Policy Center, said: \"The federal government does not deliver water from northern California to southern California.\" \"While efforts to save Delta smelt, along with salmon and steelhead trout, do reduce the amount of water that is moved from northern California by the state at certain times, it has no bearing on the current availability of water for fire-fighting.\" Although southern California is currently experiencing a drought, data shows its reservoirs are almost all currently above the historic average for this time of the year. None are at significantly low levels. One large reservoir in Pacific Palisades, the Santa Ynez Reservoir, was closed for maintenance and empty when the fire broke out, the LA Times reported. Officials from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) said that if the Santa Ynez Reservoir had been operational, it might have increased the supply of water, but that it's unclear what the ultimate effect might have been.\n",

      "On Friday, Governor Newsom confirmed reports that have been swirling this week that a water shortage hit the fire hydrants, hampering the emergency response. Firefighters in Los Angeles have told the BBC firsthand that they experienced shortages. Newsom called for an independent investigation into the loss of water pressure to hydrants and the unavailability of water from the reservoir. In a letter addressed to the heads of the LA Department of Water and Power and LA County Public Works, Newsom said that reports of inadequate water supplies are \"deeply troubling\" . \"Losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,\" he wrote. \"We need answers to how that happened,\" he continued, adding that he expects the agencies to \"fully and transparently\" share information and records for the state's probe. Adam Van Gerpen, a captain with the Los Angeles fire department, confirmed to the BBC that his crew, which has been tackling the Pacific Palisades blaze, and other crews battling other wildfires, ran out of water, forcing them to \"improvise\".\n",

Those, and the lack of rain we'd had made ideal conditions for a fire to spread quickly and intensely. I felt how quickly the wind was changing, blowing embers and smoke across the town.

I packed the important stuff first - passports, birth certificates - and then when I felt I had a bit more time, I hosed down the front of the house, hoping the water would keep my condo, one of several terraced buildings in a small development, from succumbing to the fire.

      "Three decades ago, the world was on the brink of a nuclear showdown - until Jimmy Carter showed up in North Korea. In June 1994, the former US president arrived for talks in Pyongyang with then leader Kim Il-sung. It was unprecedented, marking the first time a former or sitting US president had visited. But it was also an extraordinary act of personal intervention, one which many believe narrowly averted a war between the US and North Korea that could have cost millions of lives. And it led to a period of greater engagement between Pyongyang and the West. All this may not have happened if not for a set of diplomatic chess moves by Carter, who died aged 100 on 29 December. \"Kim Il-sung and Bill Clinton were stumbling into a conflict, and Carter leapt into the breach, successfully finding a path for negotiated resolution of the standoff,\" North Korean expert John Delury, of Yonsei University, told the BBC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kyodo Tensions soared after US suspicions rose over the nuclear plant at Yongbyon, seen here in 2008\n",
      "\n",
      "In early 1994, tensions were running high between Washington and Pyongyang, as officials tried to negotiate an end to North Korea's nuclear programme. US intelligence agencies suspected that despite ongoing talks, North Korea may have secretly developed nuclear weapons. Then, in a startling announcement, North Korea said it had begun withdrawing thousands of fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor for reprocessing. This violated an earlier agreement with the US under which such a move required the presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog. North Korea also announced it would withdraw from the IAEA. American suspicion spiked as Washington believed Pyongyang was preparing a weapon, and US officials broke off negotiations. Washington began preparing several retaliatory measures, including initiating UN sanctions and reinforcing troops in South Korea. In subsequent interviews, US officials revealed they also contemplated dropping a bomb or shooting a missile at Yongbyon - a move which they knew would have likely resulted in war on the Korean peninsula and the destruction of the South's capital, Seoul. It was in this febrile atmosphere that Carter made his move. For years, he had been quietly wooed by Kim Il-sung, who had sent him personal entreaties to visit Pyongyang. In June 1994, upon hearing Washington's military plans, and following discussions with his contacts in the US government and China - North Korea's main ally - Carter decided to finally accept Kim's invitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think we were on the verge of war,\" he told the US public broadcaster PBS years later. \"It might very well have been a second Korean War, within which a million people or so could have been killed, and a continuation of the production of nuclear fissile material… if we hadn't had a war.\" Carter's visit was marked by skillful diplomatic footwork - and brinkmanship. First, Carter had to test Kim's sincerity. He made a series of requests, all of which were agreed to, except the last: Carter wanted to travel to Pyongyang from Seoul across the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a strip of land that acts as a buffer between the two Koreas. \"Their immediate response was that no-one had ever done this for the last 43 years, that even the United Nations secretary-general had to go to Pyongyang through Beijing. And I said, 'Well, I'm not going, then',\" he said. A week later, Kim caved. The next step for Carter was harder - convincing his own government to let him go. Robert Gallucci, the chief US negotiator with North Korea at the time, later said there was \"discomfort in almost all quarters\" about the US essentially \"subcontracting its foreign policy\" to a former president. Carter first sought permission from the State Department, who blanked him. Unfazed, he decided to simply inform then-US president Bill Clinton that he was going, no matter what. He had an ally in vice-president Al Gore, who intercepted Carter's communication to Clinton. \"[Al Gore] called me on the phone and told me if I would change the wording from \"I've decided to go\" to \"I'm strongly inclined to go\" that he would try to get permission directly from Clinton… he called me back the next morning and said that I had permission to go.\" The trip was on.\n",

      "'Very serious doubts'\n",
      "\n",
      "On 15 June 1994, Carter crossed over to North Korea, accompanied by his wife Rosalyn, a small group of aides and a TV crew. Meeting Kim was a moral dilemma for Carter. \"I had despised Kim Il-sung for 50 years. I was in a submarine in the Pacific during the Korean War, and many of my fellow servicemen were killed in that war, which I thought was precipitated unnecessarily by him,\" he told PBS. \"And so I had very serious doubts about him. When I arrived, though, he treated me with great deference. He was obviously very grateful that I had come.\" Over several days, the Carters had meetings with Kim, were taken on a sightseeing tour of Pyongyang and went on a cruise on a luxury yacht owned by Kim's son, Kim Jong-il. Carter discovered his hunch was right: North Korea not only feared a US military strike on Yongbyon, but was also ready to mobilise. \"I asked [Kim's advisers] specifically if they had been making plans to go to war. And they responded very specifically, 'Yes, we were',\" he said. \"North Korea couldn't accept the condemnation of their country and the embarrassment of their leader and that they would respond. \"And I think this small and self-sacrificial country and the deep religious commitments that you had, in effect, to their revered leader, their Great Leader as they called him, meant that they were willing to make any sacrifice of massive deaths in North Korea in order to preserve their integrity and their honour, which would have been a horrible debacle in my opinion.\" Carter presented a list of demands from Washington as well as his own suggestions. They included resuming negotiations with the US, starting direct peace talks with South Korea, a mutual withdrawal of military forces, and helping the US find remains of US soldiers buried in North Korean territory. \"He agreed to all of them. And so, I found him to be very accommodating,\" Carter said. \"So far as I know then and now, he was completely truthful with me.\" Crucially, Carter came up with a deal where North Korea would stop its nuclear activity, allow IAEA inspectors back into its reactors, and eventually dismantle Yongbyon's facilities. In return, the US and its allies would build light-water reactors in North Korea, which could generate nuclear energy but not produce material for weapons.\n",

      "While enthusiastically embraced by Pyongyang, the deal was met with reluctance from US officials when Carter suggested it in a phone call. He then told them he was going on CNN to announce details of the deal - leaving the Clinton administration little choice but to agree. Carter would later justify forcing his own government's hand by saying he had to \"consummate a resolution of what I considered to be a very serious crisis\". But it did not go down well back home - officials were unhappy at Carter's \"freelancing\" and attempt to \"box in\" Clinton, according to Mr Gallucci. Near the end of the trip, they told him to convey a statement to the North Koreans, reiterating Clinton's public position that the US was continuing to press for UN sanctions. Carter disagreed, according to reports at that time. Hours later, he got on the boat with Kim, and promptly went off-script. As TV cameras rolled, he told Kim the US had stopped work on drafting UN sanctions - directly contradicting Clinton. An annoyed White House swiftly disowned Carter. Some openly expressed frustration, painting a picture of a former president going rogue. \"Carter is hearing what he wants to hear… he is creating his own reality,\" a senior official complained at the time to The Washington Post. Many in Washington also criticised him for the deal itself, saying the North Koreans had used him. But Carter's savvy use of the news media to pressure the Clinton administration worked. By broadcasting his negotiations almost instantaneously, he gave the US government little time to react, and immediately after his trip \"it was possible to see an almost hour-by-hour evolution in US policy towards North Korea\" where they ratcheted down their tone, wrote CNN reporter Mike Chinoy who covered Carter's trip. Though Carter later claimed he had misspoken on the sanctions issue, he also responded with typical stubbornness to the blowback. \"When I got back to Seoul, I was amazed and distressed at the negative reaction that I had from the White House. They urged me not to come to Washington to give a briefing, urged me to go directly to… my home,\" he said. But he went against their wishes. \"I decided that what I had to offer was too important to ignore.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A final dramatic coda to the episode happened a month later. On 9 July 1994, on the same day as US and North Korean officials sat down in Geneva to talk, state media flashed a stunning announcement: Kim Il-sung had died of a heart attack. Carter's deal was immediately plunged into uncertainty. But negotiators ploughed through, and weeks later hammered out a formal plan known as the Agreed Framework. Though the agreement broke down in 2003, it was notable for freezing Pyongyang's nuclear programme for nearly a decade.\n",

      "Sitting on the front row of a war court on the US's Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the world's most notorious defendants, appeared to listen intently. \"Can you confirm that Mr Mohammed is pleading guilty to all charges and specifications without exceptions or substitutions?\" the judge asked his lawyer as Mohammed watched on. \"Yes, we can, Your Honour,\" the lawyer responded. Sitting in court, 59-year-old Mohammed, his beard dyed bright orange and wearing a headdress, tunic and trousers, bore little resemblance to a photo circulated shortly after his capture in 2003. Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US, had been due to plead guilty this week - more than 23 years after almost 3,000 people were killed in what the US government has described as \"the most egregious criminal act on American soil in modern history\". But two days later, just as Mohammed had been set to formally enter his decision - the product of a controversial deal he struck with US government prosecutors - he instead watched silently as the judge said the proceedings had been paused under the orders of a federal appeals court. It was expected to be a landmark week for a case that has faced a decade of delays. Now, with a new complication, it continues into an uncertain future. \"It's going to be the forever trial,\" the relative of one of the 9/11 victims said.\n",
      "\n",
      "A plea on hold\n",
      "\n",
      "Mohammed has previously said that he planned the \"9/11 operation from A-to-Z\" - conceiving the idea of training pilots to fly commercial planes into buildings and taking those plans to Osama bin Laden, leader of the militant Islamist group al-Qaeda. But he has not yet been able to formally admit guilt to the court. This week's pause comes amid a dispute over a deal reached last year between US prosecutors and his legal team, under which Mohammed would not face a death penalty trial in exchange for his guilty plea. The US government has for months tried to rescind the agreement, saying that allowing the deal to go ahead would cause \"irreparable\" harm to both it and the American public. Those in support of the deal see it as the only way forward in a case that has been complicated by the torture that Mohammed and others faced in US custody and questions over whether this taints the evidence. After a last-minute appeal by prosecutors, a three-judge panel at the federal appeals court called for the delay to give them time to consider the arguments before they would make a decision. But families of victims had already flown on a once-weekly flight to the base to watch the pleas in a viewing gallery, where thick glass separated them and members of the press from the rest of the sprawling high-security courtroom.\n",

      "The attendees had won their place at this week's proceedings through a lottery system. They arranged child care and paid for kennels for their pets to attend - knowing that they could be called off at any minute. They learnt Thursday night while speaking to the media at a hotel on the base that the pleas would no longer go ahead. Elizabeth Miller, whose father, New York City firefighter Douglas Miller, died in the attacks when she was six years old, said she was in favour of the deal going forward to \"bring finality\", but recognised that there were other families who felt it was too lenient. \"What's so frustrating is that every time this goes back and forth, each camp gets their hopes up and then gets their hopes crushed again,\" she said, as other relatives nodded in agreement. \"It's like a perpetual limbo… It's like constant whiplash.\"\n",

      "This week's pause is just the latest in a series of delays, complications and controversies on the base, where the US military has now been holding detainees for 23 years. The military prison on Guantanamo Bay was established during the \"war on terror\" that followed the 9/11 attacks that Mohammed is accused of orchestrating. The first detainees were brought there on 11 January 2002. Then-President George Bush had issued a military order establishing military tribunals to try non-US citizens, saying they could be held without charge indefinitely and could not legally challenge their detention. Dressed in bright orange jumpsuits, the 20 men were brought to a temporary detention camp called X-Ray, where the cells were exposed cages and the beds mats on the floor. The camp, surrounded by barbed wire, is now long abandoned and overgrown - weeds are growing on wooden watchtowers and signs along the fence say \"off limits\" in red text. While conditions have improved at Guantanamo, it continues to face criticism from the United Nations and rights groups over its treatment of detainees. And it continues to challenge US officials and advocates who hope to see it closed. As president, Barack Obama pledged to close the prison during his terms, saying it was contrary to US values. These efforts were revived under the Biden administration.\n",

      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of suicide and acts of violence Holding his chin in his hand and staring into the distance, a probation officer tells me how he planned to end his life. \"I started to prepare how I was going to do it,\" he says. \"I needed to get out of this work situation - I'd been doing the job for so long and it had got even busier and chaotic. I just couldn't cope and I needed an exit.\" His face is expressionless and his voice is solemn. Thinking about his family stopped him from going ahead - but he says panic attacks have become a regular occurrence because of his increasing workload. \"It happens three or four times a week,\" he tells me. \"Waves of nausea, heart racing, profuse sweating, and I wake up in the night thinking: 'Have I missed something at work that could lead to someone getting hurt?' \"This is no way to live.\" This isn't an isolated case - the National Association of Probation Officers (NAPO), which represents thousands of probation officers in England and Wales, says its members are \"burning out due to the relentlessly high workloads\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Probation officers supervise offenders after prison sentences and check they follow other terms of their release, such as sticking to curfews and not taking drugs. They also help former prisoners with housing, employment and access to benefits, and protect the public by assessing the risk of further offending. In its 2022/2023 annual report, the probation watchdog assessed most of the probation service was working beyond its capacity. The probation caseload - that's the number of former offenders staff are attending to - was 238,646 at the end of June 2024. That figure is slightly higher than in 2023, when it was 238,264. Probation officers may have multiple appointments with each person. Since the HM Inspectorate of Probation report was published and those caseload figures were captured, probation officers' workloads have increased significantly - because the government released more than 2,000 offenders early from prisons in England and Wales to deal with overcrowding. The justice secretary said this had prevented the penal system from reaching maximum capacity, and \"a total breakdown of law and order\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We used to have around eight appointments a day - some with people of high risk,\" the probation officer explains, \"but that's gone up to 12 appointments - colleagues are crying at their desks as it's too much.\" Appointments can involve a probation officer and offender discussing the rules of the probation, the dates and times of future appointments, and job and training opportunities. Some offenders are serious criminals who require close and regular monitoring, and if probation officers are overworked they might miss opportunities to prevent them reoffending. The murder of Zara Aleena in east London in 2022 was partly blamed on mistakes made by probation staff. Her killer, Jordan McSweeney, attacked Ms Aleena nine days after his release on license from prison. The unit responsible for supervising him had staffing levels of just 61%. The probation officer tells me about a former prisoner who should have been visited by a probation officer but wasn't - and then went on to stab someone. \"That's what we're dealing with,\" he says. \"It's not our fault, we can't do it all. \"And then we have to live with feelings of guilt.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The government said it would recruit 1,000 new officers by March 2025 to help with the additional duties, but critics argue it takes at least a year to train a probation officer. Staff say it will take time before additional staff make any difference. \"It's not like we're going to have these extra staff now up and running which is what we want,\" another probation officer, who's been working in the sector for several years, says. \"There's not a day that passes where I don't think about quitting. We're facing excessive workloads and poor pay - all of which have led to entrenched problems of staff retention and sickness rates in crucial roles.\" Sickness levels among probation officers have gone up nationally. In the year to September 2024, HMPSS staff each lost an average of 11.4 working days to sickness absence - an increase from 11.2 average working days lost for the year ending 31 March 2024. Senior probation staff claim at least 75% of that sickness is down to stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service is also facing a significant shortfall in staff. Last year's annual report from HM Inspectorate of Probation cited \"chronic under-staffing\" and the \"knock-on impact on workloads\" as key issues of concern. There are 20,652 full-time probation staff in England and Wales - an increase of 103 on the previous year. His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) says 790 probation officers left the service in England and Wales over the last year (to the end of Sept 2024). This is a slight decrease (0.8%) compared to the previous year. \"My mental health is a mess. I'm getting upset stomachs and feeling drained all the time. It's my job and its affecting my health,\" the second probation officers says. \"I get why people are leaving - I would if I didn't have a mortgage and bills.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent inspectorate reports into probation services in various parts of the country also make for grim reading - with many identifying staffing to be an issue. In November, the Bradford and Calderdale Probation Delivery Unit in West Yorkshire was assessed by the Inspectorate to be \"inadequate\", and at risk of not protecting the public from harm because of \"large gaps in staffing\". Martin Jones, chief inspector of probation, says he's deeply concerned warning signs could be missed because of the excessive workload. \"The more pressure probation officers are under, they may miss things going wrong, so - of course - I'm acutely worried about that. \"What you're seeing is a service under huge pressure. My assessment is the probation service has too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many cases. Is that really sustainable for the long term?\"\n",

      "On the face of it, it seems a near-impossible task. Catch one of the most elusive wild cat species set loose in a landscape twice the size of the Lake District National Park. But this week experts were faced with this challenge not once, but twice. Barely 24-hours after two escaped cats were captured in the Cairngorms, wildlife authorities were hot on the trail of two more after they were spotted in the same area.\n",
      "\n",
      "This curious tale began on Wednesday night. Police Scotland posted on social media a warning that two lynx had been spotted near Kingussie, a town of roughly 1,400 people, south of Aviemore. The public were asked not to approach the animals if they encountered them. A search was launched involving Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) keepers from the nearby Highland Wildlife Park. They were faced with a few challenges. The Cairngorms National Park is the UK's biggest national park, sprawling across 1,748 sq miles and includes parts of five local authorities - Aberdeenshire, Angus, Highland, Moray and Perth and Kinross. To put that in perspective, the Lake District National Park is about 912 sq miles, while the country of Luxembourg is less than 1,000. It is a place of farms, crofts, forests and rugged hills, vast upland moors and mountains but few people. About 18,000 in total call the park home. The cats were spotted near RSPB Scotland's Insh Marshes reserve, an area of wetlands and woods on the fringes of some of the Cairngorms' highest mountains. It is also the depth of winter and it has been snowing - a lot - in the Scottish Highlands these past few weeks. Then there are lynx themselves. WWF describes them as solitary, elusive and nocturnal and rarely spotted by humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these seemingly impossible odds, the two lynx were captured successfully on Thursday - just hours after they were spotted. RZSS used cage-type traps baited with venison and quail, a small game bird. The traps were fitted with a pedal that when stepped on triggered a door to close behind the cats once inside. The keepers were able to draw on their knowledge of keeping Northern lynx at the Highland Wildlife Park. They also have past experience of collaring AWOL animals. Last year, they captured a Japanese macaque that was on the loose for five days after escaping from the park. Curiously, the lynx appeared to be far from elusive, but tame. One sat looking back calmly as a headtorch was shone at it, and an RZSS keeper spoke to the lynx and it did not run away. The pair are now in quarantine at Edinburgh Zoo. The story was tailing off when on Friday morning Police Scotland dropped another post - two more lynx had been spotted in the same area. A new search was launched involving police, RZSS, park rangers and Cairngorms Mountain Rescue Team drone. They were captured later on Friday but on Saturday it was confirmed one of the lynx had died overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are the lynx dumped pets?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a still a mystery, though police are investigating. A licence is required under the Dangerous Animals Act to keep lynx. Local authority Highland Council said no premises in the area had applied for, or were operating under a Dangerous Wild Animal (DWA) licence, suggesting they had come from somewhere else. Scotland's nature agency NatureScot also said it has not granted any licences for the reintroduction of lynx, a species once native to Britain before dying out hundred of years ago through habitat loss and hunting. Do a quick internet search to find lynx wild cats to buy and there are links to sellers in the US, but not the UK.\n",

      "Watch the moment the two lynx are captured in the Highlands\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible clue to where the \"Cairngorms Four\" originated from was reportedly found near where they were spotted. BBC Scotland News understands bedding was discovered with porcupine quills in the straw. Did whoever release the cats own other exotic animals? Wildlife groups keen to see lynx one day roam free under legal reintroductions have been highly critical of lynx being let loose. Lynx to Scotland, a three-charity partnership working to restore lynx to the Scottish Highlands, has raised serious concerns. Peter Cairns, executive director of Scotland: The Big Picture, one of the charities involved, said: \"The Lynx to Scotland Project is working to secure the return of lynx to the Scottish Highlands, and this illegal and grossly irresponsible act comes at the worst possible time, when stakeholders are engaging in good faith with productive discussions about the potential for a fully resourced legal reintroduction.\" Any official reintroduction would likely involve 20 animals released in phases over eight years.\n",

      "BBC journalist Nicole Murray, who grew up in the area, said there had been a mixture of reactions from people.

He said he had spoken to farmers in Norway in recent times who had lost livestock to lynx. Mr Macdonald said the illegal release in the Cairngorms had led farmers to bring their sheep to fields where it was easier to monitor them. \"It's caused a lot of anxiety,\" he said.\n",

      "The BBC has changed the names of the women in this article in order to protect their identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three women who were left devastated by historical child sexual exploitation in Oldham have told the BBC ministers should have spoken to survivors before deciding not to conduct a government-led inquiry into grooming gangs in the town. Jane and Amelia, who survived abuse more than 15 years ago, and Sarah, whose son was exploited in the town while he was in care, called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to meet them and hear their stories. Ministers rejected Oldham Council's request to conduct an inquiry, saying the council should lead it. A government spokesperson said it would \"always be guided\" by survivors and that Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips would continue to engage with victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "But they added \"many victims have said they do not want to see another national inquiry - they want action now\". Jane and Amelia said they would like to see a full national inquiry, because they feel it is important to cover the experiences of survivors across the country. Sarah, whose son was abused in his teens and died more than 10 years later, would have liked a government-led inquiry into abuse in Oldham, but would accept a local one if it is properly funded. \"This isn't for anyone's political gain. This is about real human beings,\" Amelia said. The government has resisted calls from the Conservatives and Reform for a new national inquiry, saying that implementing recommendations from a 2022 report conducted by Prof Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse is its priority. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said a new national inquiry would help focus on grooming gangs, where the Jay report did not. Billionaire Elon Musk has criticised the UK government over its response to grooming gangs on his social media platform X. Amelia said that, even though she did not agree with many of Musk's beliefs, she was \"glad\" he had highlighted the issue. Last weekend, Phillips and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper confirmed the council had started its own inquiry. The Greater Manchester authority also undertook an independent review into sex abuse in Oldham in 2022, and found victims had been failed by the council and Greater Manchester Police. Ministers have suggested they are keeping an open mind about a future national investigation if it becomes clear that survivors want one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane was 12 when she moved to Oldham. She made friends with a girl older than her who introduced her to a man in his late forties. \"He started coming round, buying me phones, telling me not tell my parents,\" she said, \"then he started introducing me to his friends.\" Now more than a decade later, Jane struggles to recall in detail the number of men involved - but says for six years she was abused by a British-Pakistani grooming gang. \"There was one specific incident when I was plied with alcohol, plied with drugs, and I could not move. There were a group of men coming in and out of the room, I think there must have been four or five, basically raping me.\" Jane told her mum, the police, the council and her social worker about what was going on. \"At one point, when the police had turned up, there was an illegal immigrant with me and they came and arrested me for prostitution,\" she said. Jane left Oldham several years later. \"After a certain amount of time you lose respect for yourself and it becomes a normality,\" Jane said, fighting back tears. \"When you are a child, you don't really understand, but when you get older and you look back, I felt like it was me against the world.\" As far as Jane knows, none of the men who abused her have been jailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amelia was still at school when she was trafficked across the country for sex with multiple men a night. The people who took her were white British, but she said those who abused her were from every background, race and class. \"There isn't just one narrative - the Pakistani grooming gangs,\" she said. \"It is not anything to do with nationality or race.\" Her experience was not reflected in Oldham's 2022 review on grooming. She strongly feels more work needs to be done to increase awareness of the sexual exploitation of minors. Amelia described the impact grooming has had on her life. Her children have been taken into care, she has struggled to maintain relationships and has been in and out of psychiatric support. \"I don't even class myself as a human being anymore,\" she said. \"I'm damaged goods, I'm broken.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She has also echoed Jane and Sarah's desire to meet the government on this issue. \"I'd love the opportunity to speak to those senior people who are making decisions on our lives, to meet or speak to them personally,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the women were left devastated by historical child sexual exploitation in Oldham\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah's 13-year-old son reported being sexually abused while he was a looked-after child in Oldham in the 2000s. \"He'd gone locally into a business where it was easy to buy cigarettes and alcohol and that is where the grooming started,\" she said. Her son was told he had to pay for the items by doing what the British-Pakistani owner wanted. She added the care home knew about the arrangement but did not question it. \"It totally destroyed him,\" she said. \"He just wasn't the child he was to start with. He was a shadow of his former self.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, Sarah says he was going through the process of reporting the abuse to police but had a cardiac arrest and died. \"I feel like I let him down in his life and I don't think it's right I don't get justice for him just because he's not here,\" she said. \"He is just as important as every other victim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Councillor Arooj Shah, leader of Oldham Council, said the new local independent inquiry will build on the findings of the Greater Manchester review. \"We're working closely with survivors and survivors' families to ensure they don't just have a voice, but will have a central role in developing this inquiry. We expect terms of reference to be agreed in the coming months,\" Shah said. Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Steph Parker said \"we absolutely recognise the lifelong impact of child sexual exploitation, which is why we are so committed to protecting victims and pursuing offenders. This is a tragic example that demonstrates the devastating trauma that comes with such horrific abuse.\" Parker said child protection \"is the priority\" for the force today, with several ongoing. \"We have several ongoing victim-focused, non-recent CSE investigations being led by specialist investigators, which have led to over 100 arrests. Time is no barrier to action.\" The government spokesperson added: \"Because we know there is not a binary approach to this, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women [Jess Phillips] will continue to engage with victims, to ensure their views are represented and justice can be delivered.\"\n",

      "The government should consider repatriating British members of the Islamic State group (IS) who are being held in Syrian detention camps, the government's independent terrorism legislation reviewer Jonathan Hall KC has said. Mr Hall's comments come after Donald Trump's incoming counter-terrorism chief, Sebastian Gorka, said that if the UK wanted to be seen as a \"serious ally\" of the US it should take back its citizens who joined IS. One Briton who travelled to Syria to support the jihadist movement was Shamima Begum, who left London as a teenager in 2015 and was stripped of her UK citizenship in 2019. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has insisted Ms Begum \"will not be coming back to the UK\".\n",

      "In an interview with the Times, Gorka said that \"any nation which wishes to be seen to be a serious ally and friend of the most powerful nation in the world should act in a fashion that reflects that serious commitment\" when asked if the UK should be forced to take IS members back. \"That is doubly so for the UK which has a very special place in President Trump's heart and we would all wish to see the 'special relationship' fully re-established,\" he said. Since the fall of IS in 2019, thousands of people linked to the group - mostly women and children - have been detained in camps in northern Syria. Since the toppling of former President Bashar al-Assad's regime, there are fears the upheaval could threaten the security of the detention camps. Ms Begum is among the prisoners in such camps, after travelling to Syria as a 15-year-old to support IS. She married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived. Her UK citizenship was stripped on national security grounds in 2019 and she has exhausted her legal means of appeal.\n",

      "Thousands of people braved sub-zero temperatures to watch an open-air spectacle starring magician Steven Frayne, formerly known as Dynamo, a 10-year-old rapper and a dozen aerial dancers to launch Bradford's year as UK City of Culture. Frayne told the audience he started his career performing street magic in City Park, where the opening ceremony was held, and that his home city was \"going to make its mark on the world\" in 2025. Organisers said about 10,000 people turned out to watch the show, which took place in temperatures of -3C (26.6F). Bradford is the fourth UK City of Culture, a title that is awarded every four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scheme is designed to boost the chosen city's visitor numbers, economies and reputations, and Bradford's year has received £15m government funding. Other events will include the Turner Prize, a national drawing project inspired by Bradford-born artist David Hockney, and an exhibition about the parallels between boxing and calligraphy.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Levene/Bradford City of Culture The opening ceremony's stages had towers of boxes, which the performers were inside and on\n",
      "\n",
      "Frayne said headlining Friday's opening ceremony \"means more than I could ever put into words\". \"To be in a place where there's a massive stage put right in the centre for people to come and share in some amazement, that's a dream come true, it genuinely is,\" he told BBC News beforehand. \"I'm super proud to be from Bradford. It wasn't necessarily the easiest place to grow up... so to be a small, tiny part of this [celebration], it's just incredible.\" The opening show, titled Rise, involved a cast of 200 including 10-year-old rapper Cruzy T plus poets, musicians and dancers alongside Frayne, with a theme of warts-and-all pride, unity, diversity and overcoming adversity. On the two stages, scaffold towers formed stacks of boxes containing the performers, as slogans and visuals of the city and its people were projected onto the front. Projections were also used to transform the towers into Frayne's childhood home, with a young actor playing Frayne as a boy before the real magician enlisted the crowd to take part in a series of tricks. The show will be staged again on Saturday.\n",

      "Posters in the city declare \"it's our time\" and \"it starts here\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As it happened: Relive the opening ceremony Bradford 2025 creative director Shanaz Gulzar said the opening event was intended to show that Bradford and the UK were \"incredibly diverse, representative, resilient and strong, and capable of doing magical, impossible things\". She hopes this year will give pride to Bradfordians, bring in more investment and show a new side to the city. \"There's particular press and a particular image of Bradford, which isn't true,\" she said. \"Every city in the UK has flashpoints, has challenges, and you need to give places space and time in order to navigate and come through them,\" she said. \"We are more than one flashpoint, we are more than one moment in time, we are more than our challenges - we are also our opportunities.\" Gulzar said being City of Culture had attracted funding to allow the National Science and Media Museum to have a £6m refurbishment. It reopened this week after 18 months and is staging an exhibition of a selection of Hockney's video and photography works. Meanwhile, the Hockney-inspired drawing project will run throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bradford's greatest artistic son, David Hockney, is the focus at the National Science and Media Museum\n",
      "\n",
      "Other highlights will include a tribute to Bradford playwright Andrea Dunbar, a season of films by working-class northern women, the installation of a new 15m (50ft) sculpture in the city centre, and an exhibition of striking surrealist photos by Ethiopian photographer Aida Muluneh. That exhibition will then tour to Cardiff, Belfast and Glasgow, the first time a City of Culture event has travelled to all four nations of the UK. Gulzar said winning the City of Culture title had also been instrumental in attracting a new Brit School, which has trained stars including Adele and Tom Holland. It is expected to open in 2027. However, the title has not worked its magic on everything in Bradford's cultural scene. The former Bradford Odeon, next to the site of Friday's launch event, had been due to reopen as a music venue for the City of Culture year after a £50m refurbishment. But the NEC Group pulled out of running it last year, leaving it empty and leaving the council looking for a new operator. The previous Cities of Culture - Londonderry, Hull and Coventry - saw increased attention and investment during their tenures, but there have been mixed outcomes and mixed feelings about the scheme's lasting impact after their years ended.\n",

      "BBC Mary Lamerton, 86, died in A&E on New Year's Day\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary Lamerton was a joyous person who always saw the funny side of life. She was the type of person who made sure her family remembered each other's birthdays. Daughter Sue described her 86-year-old mother as the \"lynchpin\" of the family. She recounted how Mary spent the last four days of her life on a trolley in A&E after getting in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News. Mary had a fall on 29 December and was taken into the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. She was placed in a side-room - which Sue described as \"nothing more than a glorified cupboard\" - as she had flu and staff wanted to reduce the risk of infection. This is where Mary stayed until the end of her life. She died on New Year's Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mary spent the final days of her life on a trolley because a bed was not available\n",
      "\n",
      "Stories like hers are playing out in hospitals across the country as the NHS battles intense winter pressures - which health service bosses have said are as bad in accident and emergency departments as during the Covid-19 pandemic. With flu cases continuing to rise and the cold weather exacerbating health conditions, NHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis has warned hospitals are under \"exceptional pressure\" and facing \"mammoth demand\". Earlier this week the BBC was observing doctors on a ward at Warwick Hospital when one of those critical incidents was declared. Patients had to be treated in chairs and some were left waiting for hours in ambulances because the number of people arriving was so high. Sue remembers what she saw when she first entered A&E in Brighton. \"I almost took a step backwards,\" the 67-year-old said. \"I had to take a deep breath because I was so shocked. There were just rows and rows of mostly elderly, grey, scared looking people.\" Mary was on a priority list for a bed for nearly two days but there was \"no chance\" of getting one. In the last 12 hours of her life, she received palliative care in the form of drugs while still lying on a trolley. Sue said: \"People shouldn't have palliative care like that. I'm just appalled really.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sue Lamerton said her mother was the lynchpin of the family\n",
      "\n",
      "Flu cases have continued to rise in recent weeks, with the average number of patients with the virus in hospitals in England topping 5,400 a day last week – about 1,000 higher than a week before. About 20 NHS trusts in England have declared critical incidents this week. As a retired NHS psychiatrist, Sue has sympathy for the people working in the hospital environment she witnessed. \"I could see that the staff couldn't really do very much,\" she told BBC News. \"I kind of felt ashamed. It was just an awful mess and chaos. I don't know how the staff manage to work like that day-in-day out. It must be really, really hard. \"The staff seemed so demoralised, most really did their best. The staff seemed to have either shut down or were really upset.\" Sue does not think that a place on a ward would have saved her mum's life - but, she added: \"What would have happened is she would have had a more dignified and appropriate death\". A spokeswoman for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said they \"deeply regret that we were unable to care for her with the privacy and dignity she deserved at the end of her life\". Chief Nurse Dr Maggie Davies added that emergency department teams \"are working incredibly hard under huge pressure\" and said efforts are under way \"to reduce the numbers of people coming into our A&Es and to enable patients to leave hospital sooner\".\n",

      "\n",
      "A new tablet being developed to cure intestinal worms has shown promising results in trials and could help eradicate the parasitic infection, which affects about 1.5 billion people globally, researchers say. The mango-flavoured pill is a combination of two existing anti-parasitic drugs that, used together, appear more effective in getting rid of worms. These worms are caught through contact with food or water that has been infected by soil contaminated with worm eggs and infections cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms, malnutrition and anaemia. Researchers say the pill could help overcome any future drug resistance problems and better manage the disease on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "The parasites, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), include whipworm and hookworm and are endemic in many developing countries where hygiene levels are poor. Many of those affected are children and there is no preventative treatment other than better sanitation. According a study, called \"ALIVE\", published in the Lancet, this new pill could help countries most affected reach goals set by the World Health Organization to eliminate the diseases. It would be taken as a fixed-dose of of either one single pill or three tablets over consecutive days. Researchers from eight European and African institutions say it would be a simple way to cure large numbers of people in mass treatment programmes. \"It is easy to administer, as it is one single pill,\" says project leader Prof Jose Muñoz. \"Also, we hope that combining two drugs with different mechanisms of action will reduce the risk of the parasites becoming drug-resistant,\" Prof Muñoz says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images Intestinal parasite whipworm appears to be becoming resistant to current treatments\n",
      "\n",
      "Once a person is infected, the parasites root themselves in people's digestive tracts. While the drug albendazole is good at treating some species of STH, it appears to be becoming less effective in tackling some others. During a clinical trial involving 1,001 children aged between 5-18 in Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique, it was found to be more effective on more types of infection when combined with the drug ivermectin. However, researchers said the results were not conclusive on how well it treated threadworm. Prof. Hany Elsheikha, an expert in parasitology at the University of Nottingham said the pill could be a \"significant improvement over other treatments\" and could be used against multiple parasites. \"There are some challenges with existing medications...so this could be a major, major addition.\" However, he said that while the study was \"promising\", it had \"some gaps\". \"We don't know if the results would be the same for adults, mature people, younger kids, people in other parts of the world.\" The results of the trial have been submitted to regulators in Europe and Africa, with decisions expected in early 2025. Participants are now being recruited to take part in a further trial on 20,000 people in Kenya and Ghana. Dr Stella Kepha, a researcher at Kenya Medical Research Institute who worked on the study said the pill had \" great potential for improving the health of affected communities\" but that there was still \"work to do\" to widely roll out the treatment.\n",

      "The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been asked what checks are in place to vet firms after fast-fashion retailer Shein refused to answer \"basic questions\" over its supply chain. Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, wrote to Dame Julia Hoggett asking if the stock market had tests in place to \"authenticate statements\" by firms seeking to list, \"with particular regard to their safeguards against the use of forced labour in their products\". It comes after MPs branded the evidence of a Shein lawyer \"ridiculous\" when she refused to say if the company sold products containing cotton from China. Byrne told Dame Julia that MPs were \"profoundly concerned at the lack of candid and open answers\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The committee would like to draw your attention to the concerning evidence we heard,\" he said in a letter to the LSE chief executive on Friday. The BBC understands Shein, founded in China but now headquartered in Singapore, has filed initial paperwork to list in the UK, which could value it at £50bn. It follows the retailers rapid rise to one of the biggest fast fashion firms globally, shipping to customers in 150 countries. But questions remain over the company's supply chain amid allegations of forced labour and human rights abuses. During an appearance in front of the Commons' Business and Trade Committee on Tuesday, a senior lawyer representing Shein, Yinan Zhu, repeatedly refused to say whether the company sold products containing cotton from the Xinjiang region - an area in which China has been accused of subjecting Uyghur Muslims to forced labour. Shein has denied the claims. Ms Zhu declined to answer and asked if she could write to the committee following the hearing. Her repeated refusal to answer questions about supply chains and a potential UK listing, was met with backlash from the committee of MPs, who accused her of \"wilful ignorance\".\n",
