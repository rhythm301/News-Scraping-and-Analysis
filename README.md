# News-Scraping-and-Analysis
The goal is to extract key details from news articles, including the title, author, publish date, and main content. This information can be used for tasks like building personal news feeds, trend analysis, or creating NLP datasets. Python, along with the Newspaper and Feedparser modules, is used to scrape and parse articles efficiently.
