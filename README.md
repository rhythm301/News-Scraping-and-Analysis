# News-Scraping-and-Analysis-with-Python
## Description
This project demonstrates how to scrape news articles from various sources using Python, Newspaper3k, and Feedparser libraries. The main goal of the project is to extract useful information like the title, author, publication date, and content of the articles, which can then be used for further analysis or NLP tasks.
This approach allows users to collect and analyze news from RSS feeds and websites, helping to create datasets, personal news feeds, or perform news trend analysis.
